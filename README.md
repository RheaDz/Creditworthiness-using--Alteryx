# Creditworthiness-using-Alteryx

The project involved developing a binary classification predictive model from 4 different algorithms to determine if a customer is creditworthy or non-creditworthy.
It required hyperparameter tuning of the models to get the optimal model for each algorithm and resampling to select the model that has the best performance for our prediction.
